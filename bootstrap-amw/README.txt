To generate the minified css:

- Bootstrap 3:

Checkout in ./bootstrap and ./bootswatch the relevant branches,
matching the BS version and execute ./generate.sh from this directory.

This requires a "less" executable.

- Bootstrap 5:

You need a dart-sass executable. You can download that from
https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases

Install "sass" as ./dart-sass/sass in the current directory.

Checkout in ./bootstrap and ./bootswatch the relevant branches,
matching the BS version and execute ./generate-bs5.sh from this directory.
