amusewiki (2.202-1+amw1) unstable; urgency=medium

    Given that XeTeX chocks on woff files (see debian bug #861938), this
    version installs a disabled configuration stanza for fontconfig
    excluding the woff files (which are not meant for local use anyway).
    It's up to the system admin to enable it symlinking it in
    /etc/fonts/conf.d

    Without this configuration, compilations using Charis fonts (and
    possibly others) are going to fail.

amusewiki (2.200-1+amw1) unstable; urgency=medium

    This version brings a refactored, faceted search page. To have this
    (optional) feature working, you need a libsearch-xapian-perl >
    1.2.22.0. On Debian Stretch no action is required, but Debian Jessie
    has 1.2.19.0.

    If you want the facets on the search page, you need to install a
    recent version of Search::Xapian. You can install it from CPAN
    system-wide, but it's not recommended. Instead, you could build a deb
    package with this procedure:

    # apt-get install libdevel-leak-perl libtest-pod-perl devscripts \
                      build-essential fakeroot libxapian-dev
    $ git clone https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki-debian-packages.git
    $ cd amusewiki-debian-packages/libsearch-xapian-perl-1.2.24.0/
    $ debuild -i -us -uc -b

    And install the resulting deb (as root) in the parent directory.

    The sources from the amusewiki repository have a patch to permit the
    building against the Xapian system library found in Jessie.
