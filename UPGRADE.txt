The upgrade procedure depends on the way you installed amusewiki.

*** Debian package

The recommended way is to install the application from the debian
packages. That way the upgrade is automatically managed by the
package, with zero time download.

Please note that if you are using mysql or postgresql, and the
database is currently being restarted by the upgrade procedure, you
will get a failure during the amusewiki upgrade. This is nothing to be
scared. Just run =apt-get upgrade= again and it will be fixed (again,
without the application going down).

*** Running in tree with the init script

If you installed from git and are running the app in the tree:

{{{
./init-all.sh stop
git pull
./init-all.sh start
}}}

DB upgrades are managed automatically. If some manual operation is
required, it will be listed in the Changes file.

This is the suggested script to do a 0-downtime upgrade. We don't ship
it in the distribution because it looks fragile to run a shell script
which potentially could change itself.

{{{
#!/bin/sh

set -e

./script/amusewikifarm_fastcgi.pl -l var/amw.sock -n 3 2>/dev/null >/dev/null &
temp_pid=$!
echo "Started copy of the application with pid $temp_pid. If this script exits prematurely, please kill it yourself"
echo "Waiting for the backup app to come up"
sleep 20
echo "Stopping the app"
./init-all.sh stop
git pull
echo "Starting the app"
./init-all.sh start
echo "Waiting for the new app to come up"
sleep 20
# kill the old
echo "Stopping the backup app $temp_pid"
kill $temp_pid
echo "All done, no errors"
}}}

*** Running in tree, but started with systemd and selinux

You could install this script and use it to perform the upgrades (or
do manually). Run it from root'

    owner=`ls -ld "$amusewiki/lib/AmuseWikiFarm.pm" | awk '{print $3}'`;

    echo "$amusewiki is not a directory"
    exit 2
