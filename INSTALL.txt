** INSTALLATION

The recommended way to install amusewiki is via
http://packages.amusewiki.org, where a debian repository with the
packages is provided. If you want to install manually, read on,
otherwise skip this document.

The installation of amusewiki takes time (depending on speed of the
machine and of the network) and requires about 5Gb of disk space
because of the full installation of TeXlive. If you're short on disk
space, don't even start to install (the app will create files at full
speed anyway, so consider 10Gb for a reasonable start).

On a slow server, it takes 2 hours (mostly spent on installing and
testing Perl modules, and 20 minutes to download and install the full
TeXlive 2015), but the procedure is fully automated, so start it,
check if it bails out at the beginning, forget about it for an hour or
two (run it under screen), then come back later and finish it up to
complete it for the operations which require root privileges (notably
the webserver configuration).

You can speed up the process installing the available modules and
texlive from the OS repositories, which is the suggested approch
because this way the security fixes are delegated to the standard
tools.

The supported and recommended setup is nginx + FCGI. The FCGI setup
should work with Apache as well, but it's not currently actively
supported. perldoc Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::Apache::FastCGI
should help, though.

Prerequisites:

 - a database (mysql, pg, sqlite are supported)
 - a working perl (i.e., you can install modules with cpanm without
   warnings). Usually this means you have to install liblocal-lib-perl
   and cpanminus in Debian (or you install perl in your home).
 - fontconfig (install it before installing texlive)
 - graphicsmagick (for thumbnails) and imagemagick (for preview generation)
 - a mime-info database: shared-mime-info on debian
 - fcgiwrap running and listening to /var/run/fcgiwrap.socket (as in debian)
 - a dedicated system user (with a clean home) which is going to run the site
 - SSL binaries and development libraries (openssl and libssl-dev)
 - Xapian libraries and development files (xapian-tools libxapian-dev)
 - commonly used utilities: unzip, wget, git, rsync
 - TeXlive full > 2012, either from system repo (recommended) or from
   https://www.tug.org/texlive/

Log in as the user you want to run the site.

If you have a system wide perl, to install modules in your home you
should install local::lib (liblocal-lib-perl on Debian) and add to
.profile (or equivalent):

 eval `perl -Mlocal::lib`

If you installed Tex live from the installer, tweak the shell rc file
to include the binaries in the PATH.

Logout and login again.

Unpack the sources (or clone the repo) and change directory into them.

Install the prerequisites and complete the installation with:

Complete the installation with:

 ./script/install.sh

** CONFIGURE THE INITIAL SITE

Create a database for the application. E.g., for mysql:

  mysql> create database amuse DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
  mysql> grant all privileges on amuse.* to amuse@localhost identified by XXX

Or, for postgres:

Login as root.

 su - postgres
 psql
 create user amuse with password 'XXXX';
 create database amuse owner amuse;

For sqlite no setup is required.

Copy dbic.yaml.<dbtype>.example to dbic.yaml and adjust the
credentials, and chmod it to 600. (For sqlite is good as it is).

If you have multiple amusewiki instance on the same machine, see below
before proceeding (you probably want to tweak the configuration)

Configure the initial site with:

 ./script/configure.sh [ hostname ]

Please note that the installation procedure will create a mirror of
amusewiki.org under the subdomain amusewiki.<your domain>, where <your
domain> is the output of `hostname -d`. Nothing you can't change later
from the admin console, but you need to access it. You can pass the
desired hostname as first argument to the configure script.

** USAGE

To set the number of FCGI workers, set the environment variable
AMW_WORKERS (defaults to 3).

  export AMW_WORKERS=5

To start/stop/restart the application:

  ./init-all start
  ./init-all stop
  ./init-all restart

To regenerate the nginx configuration after adding a site:

  ./script/amusewiki-generate-nginx-conf

(and read the output).


** MULTIPLE INSTALLATIONS

If you run a Debian machine and you have only one instance running and
if you have the port 9015 free, you don't need any of this.

Please note: "multiple instances" doesn't mean "multiple sites". On a
single instance you can have as many sites as you want.

The interaction between nginx and the application, including cgit, is
controlled by the Webserver model. You can configure it creating a
file in the application root named amusewikifarm_local.conf with this
content (here listed with the defaults).

<Model::Webserver>
    # cgit port
    cgit_port 9015
    log_format combined
    nginx_root /etc/nginx
    instance_name amusewiki
    fcgiwrap_socket /var/run/fcgiwrap.socket
</Model::Webserver>

The instance_name is just a string used to create the nginx
configuration files to avoid conflicts with other installations. So
you may have one instance named "testing" and the other "live".

Add to rc.conf

nginx_enable=YES
fcgiwrap_enable=YES
fcgiwrap_user=www
fcgiwrap_socket="unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap/socket"

# create an include sites-enabled directory for nginx and log dir
mkdir /usr/local/etc/nginx/sites-enabled
mkdir /var/log/nginx/
# and add an include directive in nginx.conf inside the http { } stanza, at the end.
# include /usr/local/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
vi /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf


And start the services

service nginx start
service fcgiwrap start

su - amusewiki
git clone https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki.git
cd amusewiki
eval `perl -Mlocal::lib`
./script/install.sh
# create the config
cat << EOF > amusewikifarm_local.conf
<Model::Webserver>
    nginx_root /usr/local/etc/nginx
    fcgiwrap_socket /var/run/fcgiwrap/socket
</Model::Webserver>
EOF

Then decide to which hostname you want to serve this and run
./script/configure.sh amw.localdomain

Take note of the credentials, and follow the instructions.

** CentOS 7

Texlive is obsolete, so we will install it from ctan.

From a fresh install:

# yum install epel-release
# yum install git nginx perl-local-lib sqlite cgit \
    perl-App-cpanminus fontconfig GraphicsMagick ImageMagick shared-mime-info openssl openssl-devel \
    xapian-core xapian-core-devel unzip wget libxml2 libxml2-devel expat-devel \
    policycoreutils setroubleshoot
# yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'

Tweak nginx configuration to conform to debian standard

# mkdir /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

Modify /etc/nginx/nginx.conf adding this line:

  include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

Right after "include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;"

(Probably you may also want to add "client_max_body_size 8m;" as the
default is way too low).

Start nginx:

# systemctl enable nginx
# systemctl start nginx

Open the firewall

# firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https --permanent
# firewall-cmd --reload

Prepare the installation directory for your user (say amusewiki)

# mkdir /var/www/amusewiki
# chown amusewiki:amusewiki /var/www/amusewiki

As the user which is going to run amusewiki, install a fresh perl.
This way we simplify and make our install independent from the base
system, which is lacking way too many modules.

$ eval `perl -Mlocal::lib`
$ cpanm Perl::Build
$ perl-build -j 3 --test 5.24.1 $HOME/amw-perl
$ cd /vaw/www/amusewiki
$ git clone https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki.git
$ cd amusewiki # you're now in /vaw/www/amusewiki/amusewiki, our app home
$ ./script/install-texlive.sh
$ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/amw-perl/bin:$HOME/texlive/2017/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH' >> $HOME/.bashrc
$ chmod 755 $HOME  # open the home so plackup is accessible to nginx

Logout and login again and check the program paths to point to the newly installed ones

$ which perl # should be: ~/amw-perl/bin/perl
$ which xelatex # should be ~/texlive/2017/bin/x86_64-linux/xelatex

Install cpanm and the dependencies

$ perl -MCPAN -e 'install App::cpanminus'
$ which cpanm # should be ~/amw-perl/bin/cpanm
$ cd /var/www/amusewiki/amusewiki/
$ ./script/install.sh

Decide the initial server name to serve amusewiki (to get access to
the admin), e.g. amw.localdomain.

See above if you want a mysql or postgresql database. The following
command will create a sample site with the current amusewiki
documentation.

$ ./script/configure.sh amw.localdomain

Remove the cgit wrapper, we're going to install systemd unit files.

$ rm root/git/cgit.cgi
$ ./script/generate-systemd-unit-files
$ ./script/amusewiki-generate-nginx-conf

Read the output and install the fresh nginx configuration.

Finally, open the permission for selinux. As root:

cd /var/www/amusewiki/amusewiki/doc/centos/
checkmodule -M -m -o amusewiki.mod amusewiki.te
semodule_package -o amusewiki.pp -m amusewiki.mod
semodule -i amusewiki.pp

Reboot to be sure everything is ok, open with a browser the location
you configured (say, amw.localdomain, you may want to add the entry
/etc/hosts to access it) and login.

You probably want to head to the admin panel under /admin/sites to
create a new site.
