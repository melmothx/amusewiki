   into the muse file, so they excluded from the git. Possible use
   cases: large scan files used as working copies, physical book

 - Improve check on #title upon submitting
 - Fix startup crash on older distributions GH#389

2.542 2022-03-19

 - Remove crawlable OPDS page. This is huge performance and bandwith
   waste.

 - Optimize the static indexes production. This will let datatable do
   the actual table rendering while the app will just provide the JSON
   data with some predigested HTML. The gain is huge.

   is a mistake. To be restored for selected languages only, in case.

   a file.

2.531 2021-11-21

 - Always provide an https:// site. This aligns the behavior to the
   expected one. Now "Use SSL for authenticated users" means exactly
   that, i.e. redirect login and authenticated users to https, while
   so far disabling that would have prevented https altogether. (#385)

 - Update texlive install script for TeXlive! 2021

2.515 2021-06-05

 - When pulling a remote git, remove symlinks pointing outside the
   tree. This is a security patch against potential symlink-based
   attacks coming from remote repository, tricking the application to
   access files outside the site root. [SECURITY]
 - Serve symlinks if they point inside the tree.
 - New option to toggle the display of latest entries on special pages

2.514 2021-05-23

2.455 2020-05-31

 - Updated i18n (added PL)

    In some configurations with hostile users, having local gits could
    lead to information disclosure of other repositories (setting the
    remote path to a known local git, the merge will not happen, but the
    commit summary would be listed).

2.411 2019-11-29

 - Extend the use of datatables and localize them (GH#324)

2.410 2019-11-28

 - Use datatables.net Javascript for large tables in the admin (users,
   sites and jobs) instead of monolithic tables and/or pagination.
 - Permit the creation of custom category types beside the predefined
   authors/topics (GH#311)
 - Use Text::Unidecode instead of the custom code
 - List and allow to use existing custom formats in the BookBuilder as
   preloaded settings. (GH#320)
 - List and allow to use existing images as cover in the BookBuilder
   (GH#314)
 - Allow custom format selection in the header (GH#310)
 - Add binary attachments to the infobox (GH#309)
 - When a text is not published, redirect it to /console/unpublished
   instead of a 404 for logged in users (GH#316)

To take advantage of the new BookBuilder features with images, you may
want to reindex the site with amusewiki-bootstrap-archive --refresh.
This step is however optional and doesn't prevent the normal
functioning of the sites (you're just not going to see the images as
available on the BookBuilder until you reindex the affected texts).

   be published right away. This is useful if there are no external
   contributions.

 - Support per-format template files via newest Text::Amuse::Compile

2.390 2019-07-25

   under /node. The basic functionality is there. Probably needs
   refinement with locale-aware sorting. This permits to create
   arbitrary category trees.

to https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Imager/lib/Imager/Install.pod
if in doubt.

2.201 2018-03-27

 - Bump dependency on Text::Amuse 1.00 and Text::Amuse::Compile 1.03
 - Fix secondary footnotes CSS

With Text::Amuse::Compile 1.03, a relatively recent bigfoot.sty
version is needed. If your installation is missing it (notably jessie,
stretch is fine), you can install it as the user running the amusewiki
instance with the following commands:

   $ cd /tmp/
   $ mkdir -p `kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME`/tex/latex/bigfoot
   $ wget http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/bigfoot.zip
   $ unzip bigfoot.zip
   $ cd bigfoot
   $ make
   $ mv *.sty `kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME`/tex/latex/bigfoot
   $ texhash `kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME`

2.200 2018-03-20

 - Refactored the search page, using facets now
 - Updated ru (thanks @labdsf), it and hr translations, add cs
   preliminary support
 - serve a list of urls to mirror under /mirror.txt and /mirror.ts.txt
   to feed wget with it. Plus provided a client in
   script/mirror-site.sh

This version brings a refactored, faceted search page. To get the
facets working, you need a Search::Xapian module newer then 1.2.22.0.
Notably, Debian jessie has a 1.2.19.0. Another problem is that the
current 1.2.25.0 version on CPAN fails to install using Xapian system
libraries in the 1.2 branch (I believe the issue, a single test
failing, will be addressed in the next Search::Xapian release).

Please note that without satisfying this dependency, Amusewiki will
still work without problems. You are just going to miss a nice
feature.

There are 4 cases here:

 - Debian stretch, Amusewiki installed with deb package: works out of
   the box.

 - Recent distro, with Xapian (system library) > 1.4, and Amusewiki
   installed from git. It could already work out of the box. If not
   so, upgrading Search::Xapian from CPAN (e.g. `cpanm Search::Xapian`)
   will do.

 - Older distro (with Xapian system library 1.2) and Amusewiki
   installed with git: you need to install Search::Xapian from CPAN.
   If it refuses to install because of a single test failing, force
   the installation skipping the tests `cpanm -f Search::Xapian`. I
   asked the upstream, and they confirmed it's harmless.

 - Debian jessie, Amusewiki installed with deb package: you need to
   build a recent Search::Xapian. You can install it from CPAN
   system-wide, but it has the downside of making your system dirty,
   so it's not recommended. Instead, you could build a deb package
   with this procedure (the libsearch-xapian-perl sources are provided
   as courtesy for this case, incorporating the needed patch).

   # apt-get install libdevel-leak-perl libtest-pod-perl devscripts \
                     build-essential fakeroot libxapian-dev
   $ git clone https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki-debian-packages.git
   $ cd amusewiki-debian-packages/libsearch-xapian-perl-1.2.24.0/
   $ debuild -i -us -uc -b

   And install the resulting deb (as root) in the parent directory.

 - Added texts sorting by pages
 - Enforce weak etags for files served by the application

2.101 2018-02-10

 - migrate sessions backend from fastmmap to database

The session migration is handled automatically on upgrade. The
procedure has been tested and saves a copy of the current session
storage.

Worst case scenario, your uses will be logged out. If this happens,
please report it ASAP (but shouldn't happen).

2.100 2018-02-03

 - Improved editing UI: batch file upload and ajax preview

2.099 2018-01-27

This release changes the behaviour of the <code> and =code= tag which
are now verbatim ones.

To ensure some degree of backcompatibility, if <verbatim> is found
inside a tag, a warning is issued.

<code><verbatim>Material</verbatim></code> is also considered as the
same way as =Material=.

2.098 2017-12-29

 - Add BB/CF option start_with_empty_page

 - Minor fix to the layout for search results (#168)
 - Give access to the site's jobs console to admins (#169)
 - Improve customization of navbar links (#167)

Incompatible change: if you used the configuration file to set the
SMTP parameters, you need to upgrade the setup.

You need to set the desired parameter as environment variable (in the
systemd unit file or in the user starting the application). See
https://metacpan.org/pod/Email::Sender::Manual::QuickStart and
https://metacpan.org/pod/Email::Sender::Transport::SMTP for details.

Example:

  $ export EMAIL_SENDER_TRANSPORT=SMTP
  $ export EMAIL_SENDER_TRANSPORT_host=smtp.example.com
  $ export EMAIL_SENDER_TRANSPORT_port=2525

 - Turn PDFs into custom formats (allowing fine-tuning)

This entry is not much verbose, but the changes are fairly large (with
some chance of new bugs). Notably, the publishing process has been
improved, deferring the PDF generation into a background job. Also,
the standard PDFs are now custom formats, so they can be tuned
individually.

This is supposed to be the first release of the 2.1 series, hence
numbered 2.090 with some room for minor bug-fixing releases before the
official 2.1.

 - Add an opt-in ordering by sku in the category pages (#116)

 ./init-all.sh start

If by chance you are upgrading from an earlier version, please be sure
to apply all the the intermediate sql files in the "sql" directory.


1.35 2015-10-15

 mkdir -p root/static/js/validate
 cd root/static/js/validate
 wget http://jqueryvalidation.org/files/jquery-validation-1.14.0.zip
 unzip jquery-validation-1.14.0.zip

Please reconfigure cgit to pick up the correct paths. Now you're not

need the git:// cloning.

 ./script/install-cgit.pl --reconfigure

   across different instances

The fcgi_params reference was removed from the nginx configuration. If
you want to upgrade, execute:

And install the generated file as explained in the output (meant to be
cut and pasted as root).


1.31 2015-08-18

 - Refactored the nginx config generator
 - CSS fix for cgit
 - declare the encoding when serving static text files
 - updated translations: de

The new nginx configuration setup has a stanza for each site, to make
room for different SSL certificates. The common configuration was
moved to an included file.

To upgrade the configuration, execute

  script/generate-nginx-conf.pl

And install the generated file as explained in the output (meant to be
cut and pasted as root).

 - Integrated cgit into the layout.
 - Optional upgrade to cgit latest release (0.11.2)
 - Unified the installation scripts install-cgit.sh and generate-cgit-repolist.pl

without argument.

  script/install-cgit.pl

Notes: install libssl-dev if you're getting the error about missing
openssl/ssl.h during compilation.

Due to the new setup (with cgit listening only to localhost), you need to regenerate the nginx configuration with

This is a bug-fixing only release

1.06 2015-02-21

 - Bumped up prerequisites: Text::Amuse::Compile
 - Updated translations: mk
 - Added EPUB output to Bookbuilder
 - Added font embedding option to Bookbuilder's EPUBs
 - Added user administration (only for root users)

There is no DB upgrade, but to get the font embedding working you need
to populate the "webfonts" directory. To do so:

  cd webfonts
  ./populate-webfonts.pl

If you have the fonts installed and the fc-list output is parsable,
you should see the directory full of fonts. The space (ab)used with
these copies is about 32Mb (if you can't have 50Mb spare, better you
don't run this application at all).

1.05 2015-02-07

 - Bumped up prerequisites: Text::Amuse, Text::Amuse::Compile,
   PDF::Imposition
 - Added "opening" option to the site options.
 - Updated translations: it, hr.
 - Safe old revision (published) and job (completed) purging.
   Revisions and jobs older than 1 month will get be purged from the
   database and the associated files removed. Of course, this doesn't
   mean that the texts themselves are removed, just the revision.

This change is minor but requires a db upgrade. You have to apply the
incremental script at sql/AmuseWikiFarm-Schema-1.02-1.05-<your-db>.sql
before the server restart.

1.04 2015-01-08

 - Updated translations: ru, mk
 - Job page will show the queue, if any
 - Fixed bug with category's names being stuck on the first-come

No DB or dependencies upgrade required.

1.03 2014-12-07

 - Added 4UP imposition schema to the bookbuilder. The prerequisite of
   PDF::Imposition has been bumped up.
 - Bumped up Text::Amuse to fix a crash in some corner case with weird markup.
 - Added 9pt to the bookbuilder options.
 - The current running version is now shown as an empty file in the app dir.
 - Display the current cover image in the bookbuilder, if any.
 - Added sorting to topics and authors pages.
 - Extended the check on cross-site sessions. As a side effect, the
   logs should not be spammed anymore by dumb messages about session
   deletions because of UA mismatch.

If you use nginx, this upgrade requires a change in the ngnix
configuration. You can run again the script/generate-nginx-conf.pl and
check the differences produced. If you prefer the manual way, add this
stanza in the amusewiki server { } stanza:

    location /private/bbfiles/ {
        internal;
        # the following should be the actual path
        alias /home/amuse/amusewiki/bbfiles/;
    }

Modules to upgrade via CPAN: Text::Amuse and PDF::Imposition. Running
perl Makefile.PL will check if you got the correct versions.
