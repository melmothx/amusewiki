# This step lists t/**.t, so that we can run the tests in a matrix on it in github.
#   When you run each test as it's own step we get the results testing broken up into a 
# nice list in the side bar, and github can schedule the test however it likes. 
#
# It's worth noting that we skip having t/00-prepare-tests in this list because it is run
# before each test in the matrix.
